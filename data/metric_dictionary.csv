Descriptor Statistics,,,Used to summarize basic and statistical infromation of the datasets
Descriptor Statistics-Global Summary,Global Summary,,"Summarize global information about the datasets like number of rows and columns, name and number of categorical and numerical attributes"
Descriptor Statistics-Statistics by Metric Type,Statistics by Metric Type,Measures of Shape,Describe the distribution(or pattern) of different attributes in the datasets using skewness and kurtosis
Descriptor Statistics-Statistics by Metric Type,Statistics by Metric Type,Measures of Central Tendency,"Describe the central position of each attributes in datasets by finding basic measures like mean, median and mode"
Descriptor Statistics-Statistics by Metric Type,Statistics by Metric Type,Measure Of Percentiles,Indicate the value below which a given percentage of data of given attribute falls
Descriptor Statistics-Statistics by Metric Type,Statistics by Metric Type,Measures Of Dispersion,"Measure the spread of data about the mean e.g., Standard Deviation, Variance, Covariance, IQR and range of each attribute of datasets"
Descriptor Statistics-Statistics by Metric Type,Statistics by Metric Type,Measures Of Cardinality,Measure the count of unique values present in each attribute
Descriptor Statistics-Statistics by Metric Type,Statistics by Metric Type,Measures Of Counts,"Measure the sparsity of the datasets, e.g., fill count and percenatge, missing value count and percentage and nonzero count and percenatge"
Descriptor Statistics-Attribute Visualization,Attribute Visualization,Numerical,Visualize the distributions of Numerical attributes using Histograms
Descriptor Statistics-Attribute Visualization,Attribute Visualization,Categorical,Visualize the distributions of Categorical attributes using Barplot
Quality check,,,Used to check the quality of a datasets both at column level and row level. 
Quality check-Column Level,Column Level,IDness Detection,
Quality check-Column Level,Column Level,Null Detection,"Detect the sparsity of the datasets, e.g., count and percentage of missing value of attributes"
Quality check-Column Level,Column Level,Baisedness Detection,Detect the baisedness of the attributes by finding the mode and its percenatge(value that is most frequent in the data)
Quality check-Column Level,Column Level,InvalidEntries Detection,Detect the entries and count of invalid values or noise present in the datasets
Quality check-Column Level,Column Level,Outlier Detection,Used to detect and visualize the outlier present in numerical attributes of the datasets
Quality check-Row Level,Row Level,Duplicate Detection,Measure number of rows in the datasets that have same value for each attribute
Quality check-Row Level,Row Level,Rows WMissingFeats,Measure the count/percentage of rows which have missing/null attributes
Association & Interactions,,,Used to find interesting associations and relationships among attributes of daatsets
Association & Interactions-Association Matrix,Association Matrix,Correlation Matrix,Measure the strength of relationship among each attribute by finding correlation coefficient having range -1.0 to 1.0.
Association & Interactions-Association Matrix,Association Matrix,IV Calculations,Information Value Calculations- Used to rank variables on the basis of their importance.Greater the value of IV higher rthe attribute importance. IV less than 0.02 is not useful for prediction
Association & Interactions-Association Matrix,Association Matrix,IG Calculations,Information Gain- Measures the reduction in entropy by splitting a dataset according to given value of a attribute.
Association & Interactions-Association Matrix,Association Matrix,Varibale clustering,Divides the numerical attributes into disjoint or hierarchical clusters based on linear relationship of attributes
Association & Interactions-,,,
Association & Interactions-Association Plot,Association Plot,Correlation Matrix,Used to Visualize the strength of relationship among attributes by ploting heat map
Association & Interactions-Association Plot,Association Plot,IV Calculations,Used to Visualize attribute importance of in increasing or decreasing order using barplot
Association & Interactions-Association Plot,Association Plot,IG Calculations,"Used to visualize the purity of attributes in dataset using barplot i.e., how a change to the datasets impact the distribution of data."
Association & Interactions-Association Plot,Association Plot,Varibale clustering,Used to visualize how numerical featrures are group together into different clusters formed by variable clustering
Association & Interactions-Attribute to Target Association,Attribute to Target Association,Numerical ,Used to Visualize the bucket-wise percentage/ditribution of data for Numerical attributes having Target Variable greater/less than or equal to given threshold value
Association & Interactions-Attribute to Target Association,Attribute to Target Association,Categorical,Used to Visualize the Category-wise percentage/distributions of data for categorical attributes having Target Varibale greater/less than or equal to  given threshold value.
Data Drift ,,,Used to monitor differences between target and source datasets 
Data Drift -Data Drift Analyzer,Data Drift Analyzer,PSI,Population Stability Index- Measure how much a attribute has shifted in distribution between two sample of dataset(target and source datasets )
Data Drift -Data Drift Analyzer,Data Drift Analyzer,JSD,Jensen-Shannon Divergence- Used to quantify the difference(or similarity) between distributions of two sample data(target and source datasets). It ranges between 0-1. smaller the score of JSD higher the similarity of two datasets. 
Data Drift -Data Drift Analyzer,Data Drift Analyzer,HD,Hellinger Distance- Measure the similarity in distribution between two sample of dataset(target and source datasets ). Smaller the value of hellinger distance higher the similarity in distribution of two sample dataset.
Data Drift -Data Drift Analyzer,Data Drift Analyzer,KS,kolmogorov-Smirnov Test- It quantifies a distance between distribution of two sample dataset to check the similarity between them. Greater the value of K-S test p-value higher the similarity between two dataset.
